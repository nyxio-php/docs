# Events

> Listen, dispatch, enjoy. Very simple.

Events are powerful tools for handling application (and framework!) events. 
<br>User create an acount? Create Even, attach listeners for notifications, logs and other things and dispatch ehen it happend.
<br>User make an order? Do the same. 
<br>And many more cases for using `Events` in your app.

1. Create `Event` class:

```php
<?php

```

2. Attach listeners, who will handle this `Event`

```php
<?php

```

3. Trigger your `Event` using the `EventDispetcherInterface`

```php
<?php

```
